0 .fits files must be created using Allyn Tennant's evt2fits code and gse2fits codes. The ftool fselect is used to select single events and make a new science data fits file.

1. Fit the lines for the Am scans for each position in each detector
IDL>.run fit_amscan_lines5 - this code runs first.
It writes a fits file for each detector in the fits_files subdirectory. 
fits_files/Det<det#>_asmscan_line_fit_results.fits

2. Fit lines at several energies from measurements using broad illumination of each detector
IDL>.run fit_heroes_lines_and_res_double_peakedgaussian6.pro
This code uses the fits files from step 1 and outputs a fits file for each detector in the fits_files subdirectory
fits_files/Det<det#>_onaxis_line_fit_and_resolution_doublepeak_gauss_<gain date>_gain_corrected.fits

3.Fit Cd109 lines from the flight to create a gain correction vs time.
IDL> .run fit_cd109_corrections2.pro
This code applies the gain corrections from steps 1 & 2 and extracts time intervals from the GSE data when detector voltages were at nominal values. Once these corrections are applied, it fits the Cd109 K-alpha (and K-beta) lines to 1800-s intervals of science data to determine a gain correction that puts the Cd109 K-alpha peak at 23.1081 keV. This code outputs a file for each detector
fits_files/Det<det#>_cd109_line_fit_results.fits

4. Apply all of the gain corrections to the flight data and add a new field called "Energy" that is the gain corrected energy for each event.
IDL> .run make_gain_corrected_flight_files.pro
This code applies all of the gain corrections in steps 1-3 to the flight data and outputs new gain corrected data files tot the subdirectory gc_flt_data

gc_flt_data/det0<det#>s_gc.fits

5. Now see what the data look like. Make images for each detector using the gain corrected flight data for the Sun
IDL> .run plot_solar_data.pro
